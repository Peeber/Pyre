Crucible and Catharsis is a demo of a 2D psychological horror action rpg focused on instanced combat and exploration. The combat is based on bullet hell games and allows the player to counterattack by activating their own abilities whenever their gradually increasing Focus bar reaches 100%. The demo will cover the first combat encounter of the game and a small story segment leading up to it in order to showcase the combat engine, enemy AI, and various other systems within the game.
This demo will eventually be expanded into a story-driven game with multiple routes based off player choices that allow the player to experience multiple sides of the game's story and gain different abilities tailored to various playstyles.
